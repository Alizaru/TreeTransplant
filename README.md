Once you're in the tree transplant menu it's simple to start moving your trees.

First, left-click on the tree you wish to move to highlight it.  By left-clicking again you can move the tree to a new location.

A tree can only be relocated when all of the surrounding tiles are green, 
if they are red that means there is a collision with another object such as a rock or building.

Certain trees also have different requirements for growth like this sapling which needs all surrounding tiles to be clear in order to grow.

By right-clicking with a tree selected or using the flip button in the bottom right corner you can flip the tree around for trees that support it.

Using the close button the bottom right or hitting your exit key on your keyboard (default escape) 
you can close out of this menu and return back in front of Robin.

## Knonw issues

There is only some graphics issues that I planned to take care later if I found the problem.
I am totally open if someone have an idea and do a pull request.

- The sprite of modded tree can be wrong on ghost mode
- The stump can be invisible on ghost mode
